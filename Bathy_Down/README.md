The bathymetry data acquired from different sources could be vary in terms of resolution and accuracy. 
When utilizing such data in research, it is essential to carefully evaluate and select the dataset most suitable for the specific area of interest.

The following notes are provided regarding the use of this script:

1. For ETOPO 1 data, it has been raised that the `.mat` file format may contain broken data in certain cases. 
However, data downloaded the same area with `.nc` format has no issue.
2. For GEBCO, this script provides the 2019 version. 
For the most up-to-date version, it is recommended to download the dataset directly from the official GEBCO website.

The below figures are examples of bathymetry using the data from this script.
